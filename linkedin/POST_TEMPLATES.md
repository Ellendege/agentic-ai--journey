# LinkedIn — Post Templates

## Post 1 — The Pivot
Hook: I switched from LangChain to SmolAgents mid-build — here’s why it sped up my GAIA agent.
Lesson: Baseline first (InferenceClient) → frameworks second. Version pins + minimal repro saved hours.
CTA: Comment “baseline” if you want my starter scripts.

## Post 2 — The Import Trap
Hook: “ImportError: HfApiModel” — fixed in minutes by checking package exports.
Lesson: Align docs to the exact installed version.
CTA: I’ll share a version-audit checklist.

## Post 3 — Provider/Task Mismatch
Hook: The model worked… until the provider rejected the task.
Lesson: Keep a known-good list; test one-liners.
CTA: Want my compatibility notes?

## Post 4 — GAIA Output Compliance
Hook: Passed after I wrapped outputs.
Lesson: Judges need clean final strings, not logs.
CTA: I’ll share my run_agent() wrapper.
